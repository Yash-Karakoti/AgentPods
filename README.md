# Agent Pods  

---

## ðŸ“– Description

AgentPods is a decentralized platform for creating and monetizing **Intelligent NFTs (iNFTs)** that encapsulate AI agents or models.  
Users can **mint**, **lease** and **run AI inference jobs** on-chain while model storage, execution and availability are handled via the **0G ecosystem**.  

This enables **secure ownership**, **transparent monetization** and **censorship-resistant AI services** that are verifiable on-chain.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v18 or higher  
- **npm** or **pnpm** package manager  
- A **0G Galileo Testnet wallet** with test tokens  
- **Git** installed  
- **Basic Web3 wallet** (MetaMask recommended)

---

## ðŸ›  Usage

1. **Mint an AI Agent iNFT** â€“ Upload your AI model to **0G Storage** and store the reference in the NFT metadata.  
2. **List for Lease** â€“ Allow others to rent and run your AI agent for a fee.  
3. **Run Inference Jobs** â€“ Renter submits an input, job runs on **0G Compute** and output is stored in **0G Storage** or **0G DA**.  
4. **Settle Payments** â€“ Lease smart contract handles usage receipts and payment settlement.  
5. **Verify & View** â€“ All activity is transparent on the 0G Chain and viewable via explorer.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **On-chain AI Ownership** â€“ Securely own AI models as iNFTs.  
- **AI Leasing Marketplace** â€“ Monetize models via time based or usage based leasing.  
- **Verifiable Compute** â€“ Jobs executed via 0G Compute are recorded and traceable.  
- **Decentralized Storage** â€“ Models, datasets and outputs stored on 0G Storage.  
- **EVM Compatible** â€“ Built on 0G Chain with Solidity smart contracts.

##  Why This Project is Required & Problems It Solves ?

AI in Web3 today faces 4 major challenges:

1. **Centralized Model Hosting** â€“ Most AI models are stored and served by centralized providers, creating dependency, censorship risk and single points of failure.
2. **Lack of True Ownership** â€“ NFTs usually store static images or metadata not functional AI agents that users can actually own, run or improve.
3. **Opaque Computation** â€“ AI outputs from centralized APIs are unverifiable, making it impossible to confirm whether the claimed model was actually used.
4. **No Monetization Path for AI Creators** â€“ Independent AI developers have no simple, trustless way to monetize models while retaining full control.

**AgentPods** solves these issues by:

- Turning AI models into **on-chain Intelligent NFTs (iNFTs)** with verifiable storage and execution.
- Using **0G Storage** for censorship-resistant hosting of models, configs and datasets.
- Running inference jobs on **0G Compute** and recording proofs in **0G Data Availability (DA)** for auditability.
- Enabling **permissionless leasing and monetization** through smart contracts on **0G Chain**.

This ensures AI agents are **ownable, rentable, verifiable and censorship resistant** -> a core need for truly decentralized AI ecosystems.

## USP

Unlike centralized AI platforms, AgentPods provides **true digital ownership** of AI models, **on-chain verifiable computation** and a **permissionless AI marketplace**. This enables AI creators to monetize without intermediaries, while users get provably fair access to AI services.
